## Installation

In your Gemfile:

**Spree edge**

```ruby
gem 'spree'
gem 'spree_gateway', github: 'spree/spree_gateway', branch: 'master'
```

**Spree 1.3**

```ruby
gem 'spree', '~> 1.3'
gem 'spree_gateway', github: 'spree/spree_gateway', branch: '1-3-stable'
```

**Note:** *Please consult the Versionfile at the root of the repository to determine which branch to use.*

Then run from the command line:

    $ bundle install
    $ rails g spree_gateway:install

Finally, make sure to **restart your app**. Navigate to *Configuration > Payment Methods > New Payment Method* in the admin panel and you should see that a bunch of additional gateways have been added to the list.
